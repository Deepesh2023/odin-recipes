        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This unstuffed pepper skillet is much easier to make than actual stuffed peppers but packs just as much flavor. A super satisfying and delicious dish.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>8 ounces mini sweet peppers, sliced crosswise (about 10 peppers, mixed colors)
            <li>1 cup chopped yellow onion
            <li>1 pound lean ground sirloin (90/10)
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons Italian seasoning
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
            <li>¼ cup water
            <li>3 tablespoons hot cherry pepper hoagie spread (such as Cento)
            <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 (8.8 ounce) package microwavable white rice (such as Uncle Ben’s), crumbled</li>
            <li>cup shredded Italian cheese blend</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil or flat-leaf parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add peppers and onion; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add beef and cook, stirring to crumble, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Season with garlic and Italian seasoning and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomato sauce, water, hoagie spread, and salt.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in rice until coated evenly with sauce. Cover, reduce heat to medium to maintain a simmer, and cook until rice and vegetables are tender, about 8 minutes, stirring once halfway through to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Uncover, remove from heat, and sprinkle with shredded cheese. Re-cover and let sit until cheese melts, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve hot sprinkled with basil or parsley.</li>
        </ol>
